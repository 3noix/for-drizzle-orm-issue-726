To provide an example for the [drizzle-orm issue #726](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/726)

All dependencies are in `package.json` (no use of dev dependency installed globally).

If you also want to try to run it (not strictly necessary as the issue is only a typing issue), you can use the `db.db` file and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html). To obtain `db.db` I executed the code from the file `main.sql`.
